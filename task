# CRM (Customer relationship management) - demo application

## Stage 1
Goals: Deploy the web application - "CRM" and expose it to the internet.

A few notes:
- The Demo CRM is a NextJS application (a NodeJS + React app).
- The application listens on port `3000`.
- If you're interested, its source code can be found here: https://github.com/yuvalo/demo-crm
- And today, you are going to use the publicly available Docker image: `pwstaging/demo-crm:latest`

Tasks:
- Write your own Deployment YAML manifest. One replica shall be enough.
- Write your own Service YAML manifest. Expose externally using a LoadBalancer with port 80 (or a NodePort, if your cluster doesn't allow).
- Add resource requests to the CRM deployment.

Tips:
- The resource request values may be arbritrary (for the sake of the exercise), but they should make some basic sense.


## Stage 2
Goals:
- Add a high-availability Mongo database (via a Helm Chart).
- Make sure the database is not exposed outward/publically.
- Configure the CRM application to use the database.

Tasks:
- Install MongoDB from a public Helm Chart.
- Use values to make sure that you are running with three mongo replicas.
- Use values to make sure that you are running with persistence.
- Make sure that the MongoDB has authentication enabled.
- Update the application to use these credentials.

Tips:
- Use the official Mongo documentation to understand about configuring its *Connection String*s.
- Don't get confused with *Kuberenetes ReplicaSets* and *MongoDB Replicas Sets*.
- You may use either 3 replicas with a StatefulSet or 2 replicas with 1 *Arbiter*.


## Stage 3
Goals:
- Purge database nightly.
- Reimplement CRM application as a Helm chart.

Tasks:
- Add a CronJob that purges all MongoDB entries (CRM users) every midnight - "we want to start the day with clean DB!".
- Wrote a Helm chart for the CRM application. Extract every *reasonable* variable you can into the `values.yaml`!
- Configure MongoDB to be a *dependency chart* in Demo CRM's `Chart.yaml`.

Tips:
- Finish adding the CronJob before moving on to creating the Helm chart.
- A few examples of useful values to include in your `values.yaml`:
  - Number of replicas.
  - Database authentication details.
  - Application configuration values.
  - CronJob schedule; and if to create it at all or not.
- For "inspiration", look at how popular/major/official charts' `values.yaml` are organized, and some of the variables they allow.
